```
Wait hold up a minute
I think that I'm feeling sick
From all this automatic
Driving to your house
I'm gonna die in LA traffic
Watch me crash my fucking
Car into your couch
Don't want to finish up this episode
Before you cut me out
(Yuh)
Head so foggy cause a day long
Please zoom out cause I'm way down
I'm still down cause I'm way up
You can never take me
I'm just living life
I guess a bottle wouldn't break me
Thinking bout a thousand reasons
Why you probably hate me
And if you pull up
I'd be your biggest fan
But shouldacoulda
I'm thinking bout the past
And if I woulda
Even stood a chance
When your foot was on my dash
Know it only made me crash
I know I shoulda
Had been your biggest fan
But shouldacoulda
I'm thinking bout the past
And if I woulda
Even stood a chance
And I know I shouldn't ask
But I really want you bad now
I been thinking bout
Topics to talk about
And sort it out and make it right in my head
Now that it's been longer
Know that I was wrong for
Thinking that you always had a place in my-
Is this what I had in mind?
Twenty five million missed calls
My hands are shaking withdrawls
I guess that I found my pitfall
Oh god I hope you take me
But I'm just living life
I guess a bottle wouldn't break me
Thinking bout a thousand reasons
Why you probably hate me
And if you pull up
I'd be your biggest fan
But shouldacoulda
I'm thinking bout the past
And if I woulda
Even stood a chance
When your foot was on my dash
Know it only made me crash
I know I shoulda
had been your biggest fan
But shouldacoulda
I'm thinking bout the past
And if I woulda
Even stood a chance
And I know I shouldn't ask
But I really want you bad now
But if I was lying
There would be an awkward silence
Between words I'd try to tie
In a text and a call
And a drive
And on top of it all
You were right
I was wrong
You were right
Maybe I'm dying
I've been putting on mileage
Shouldacoulda wrote a song
Or a text or a call
You tomorrow we can talk through it all
Pick me up when I fall
Pick me up
